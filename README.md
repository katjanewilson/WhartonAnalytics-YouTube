# COVID-19 Prediction Tool

Central to the debate of ethical algorithm design is a consideration of mis-classification costs for supervised learning methods. By building in asymmetric costs through sampling, machine learning engineers can take heed of policy makersâ€™ desired cost-ratios. This random forest algorithm takes asymmetric sampling into account when predicting death rates of coronavirus patients in South Korea using the Kaggle COVID-19 Open Research Dataset.

# Wharton Analytics Fellows - YouTube

Trending videos on YouTube do not simply increase viewership, they also inspire new content and engagement from creators. With such a large and diverse dataset of videos, product teams rely on unsupervised learning methods to find similar features among trending videos. Using a large dataset of YouTube videos, we explore trends to guide the marketing team.
